# Inventory Management System
The Inventory Management System is designed to streamline and optimize the process of managing inventory for businesses. Although every form of business has a need to manage their inventory, this application will focus on benefitting the front-line workers in workplaces such as retail stores, warehouses, and even inside of a service/kitchen environment.

This application will be most useful in smaller to medium-sized businesses wanting to better improve the management of their inventory/stock levels. It will be a tool that keeps everything accurate and up-to-date.

## Progress Log
### Wednesday, 26th June
Hello everyone!

Just your local neighbourhood Marty chiming in and giving you the latest news! I've only had one can of BOSS coffee - caramel flavour, if you were curious - but I can't seem to get to sleep, so here I am!

Today's session saw us break into our assigned teams and start both coding and finalizing our intentions and aspirations for this project. We had long decided on creating an Inventory Management System because we were jealous that others had made something actually useful for Unit 2!! I made an online game shopfront, Johnny and Jackson both made a Pokedex/Team Builder app, and Kiran created a directory of sorts that featured user management.

Of us four, Kiran's app was the most useful to the wider community - the other three of us just poured our souls into a passion project each!! - so we all agreed that we would create something that we can make the others in the class jealous of this time >:D

A lot was done today, where we spent the beginning of the evening on making sure that we all knew how to use GitHub properly as a team. I have to say, it is definitely a lot more confusing when you have to start sharing a repository. I noticed straight away that we definitely needed more time to understand the intricacies behind it. There was a lot of good communication between us, but ultimately we required the assistance of Corey - praise R-llah - who really helped us wrap our heads around the 'rebasing' concept.

We also decided that we were going to be using Bootstrap for our CSS template(s). I think it will really save us a lot of time and effort, because it's really just copy/pasting the classes and ids from what's giving on the website. The difficulty comes in understanding the template you've decided to use for your project. As normal, you need to make sure that every class/id matches in both the HTML and the CSS files. Daunting task.

Jackson was the main driving force for tonight. I'm glad that I have him on the team, as listening to one commander brings about clarity. Not every team will settle for having one commander at a time. I'm all for sharing the role across sessions/time spent together, but there should ever only be one person leading at a time.

I hope to see Johnny step up to fulfill his role as the scrum master in the sessions to come.

Kiran was understandably spending a lot of time and care in making sure the CSS was correct. As mentioned above, HTML and CSS files need to match up on their tags/classes/ids for it to actually work, so it's a lot of attention-to-detail work. I don't think that we were able to work too well with Kiran, as a lot of the time, he was concerned that the HTML that we were writing wasn't going to line up well with the CSS that comes from the template. During the demonstration Corey did with us, for GitHub, his initial work on the base.html file was also deleted because he was trying to rebase from the main branch. Poor guy...

As for me, I'm perfect in every way, so what more is there to say? Nah, just kidding. I had my frustrations with the code as well. Although I had started the skeleton of the code for this project, I had to rewrite it and make sure it all still worked. Initially, I had thought that it wouldn't matter too much what naming conventions we used, but I came around to the fact that we should be writing our code to be easier to read. I also feel pretty shitty that I wasn't able to help Johnny fix the issue that he was having with implementing the Categories entity into the code.

We spent a good amount of the last part of the night trying to do this, and even went beyond 10:00PM to try get it sorted to no avail. I managed to get it all up and running, and tested it multiple times before pushing it to the repo, but I'm still disappointed in myself that I wasn't able to spot what it was exactly that Johnny's code for the categories was wrong. I know that Johnny's code is solid and there must've been just 1 or 2 characters that threw the whole thing off.

Thanks for a great night of coding, team! Let's get this project done quickly so I can put more time into playing games ;D
